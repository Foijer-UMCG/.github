## Foijer Group GitHub repository

Welcome to our code repository - here you'll find up to date version of pipelines, analysis scripts used for generation of plots found in our papers and other coding related information.

The Foijer group works on Chromosomal INstability (CIN), a feature of cancer where gains and losses of genomic material are frequent, leading to aneuploidy. 
We study CIN through measurement of genetic heterogeneity on single cell level, live cell imaging of chromosome mis segregations, and pipelines for analysis of bulk expression data.
